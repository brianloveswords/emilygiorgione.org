title: Bachelor of Fine Arts Exhibition

description: |
  I designed the poster, exhibition title wall and artist statements for
  the 2008 Bachelor of Fine Arts exhibition. The poster design is based
  on a map showing directions from the Art Building to the exhibition
  space in Willimantic, Connecticut. Since the budget for this project
  was limited, I decided to use leftover posters to create the title
  wall and artist statements.
