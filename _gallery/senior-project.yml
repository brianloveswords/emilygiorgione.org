  “Channel RGB” is an investigation of visual distortion and re-imaging
  to create moments of beauty within cacophony. Television is an
  everincreasing presence in our daily lives, infusing and infecting
  visual culture with its manipulation, deception and its limitless
  boundaries. I’ve combined frames to simulate the concept of image
  overload, while also slowing down to capture points of beauty and
  unpredictability. Is this fusion of multiple commercials re-presented
  as one continuously flowing stream of overlapping visuals the sign,
  the signifier or the signified of society’s collectively max-ed out
  visual space?  Separating RGB channels and overlapping frames to
  produce abstract imagery, attempts to form new interpretations while
  depriving the viewer of any contiguous narrative or single
  conclusion.
